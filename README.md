Exploratory Data Analysis Project on Gender Inequality Index

note: The 'Gender inequality & HDI Analysis.pdf' contains the entire code with all visualizations. This was included since Jupyter sometimes fails to load and display world maps.

1. This project explores the Gender Inequality Index of countries around the world to draw insights about the prevelant gender bias in terms of work force, political reservations, maternal mortality, education and adolescent birth rates. 
2. It also compares the aforementioned factors with the official Human Development Index and surveys countries accordingly.
3. The final part involves Tableau visualization of the overall report.
